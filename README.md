A New Repository

I am husband and a father. This is the part of me that I know I show the least. It is the part of me that drives me to accomplish great things in this world. The part that knows to help others by using the gifts that God has given me is my purpose in life. I am a man that knows he should pray, but life caries me so deep into my work that I lose site of this part often. This is a readme file. That is a funny name for a file, whos intended purpose is to be read I assume. It should say, you human, yes you there! Come and learn of my culture. Let me tell you a story a prelude a humm of and be still just for a moment. Now you may enter. 

Hellow Wolrd.
